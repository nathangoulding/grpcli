# grpcli

`grpcli` is a command-line client for gRPC.

### Features

* Connect to any gRPC service
* List all available gRPC methods from a service
* Call any gRPC method passing native javascript objects that get converted to protobuf messages
* Automatically reconnect via standard gRPC backoff retries

### Installation

`npm install -g grpcli`

### Prerequisites

* A gRPC service listening on a reachable IP and port
* The `.proto` file describing the gRPC service
* `npm` installed

### Using grpcli

Command-line arguments can be passed in via CLI flags, for example:

```
[user@host]# grpcli -f myservice.proto --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=3466
```

#### Configuration File

You can place any necessary configuration in an `.grpclirc` file in your home directory.

```
[config1]
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
dir = /path/to/proto/files1
file = my1.proto
insecure = true

[config2]
ip = 192.168.1.1
port = 8888
dir = /path/to/proto/files2
file = my2.proto
insecure = false
```

To load up a specific configuration, pass in the section:

```
[user@host]# grpcli config1
```

Or

```
[user@host]# grpcli config2
```

#### Making Calls

Once you are connected you will be able list and make calls to the gRPC service:

```
[user@host]# grpcli config1
Info: Using `config1` config from: /home/user/.grpclirc
Package: mypackage
Service: MyService
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8080
Secure: Yes
[grpc+insecure://127.0.0.1:8080]# rpc list
listObjects(ListObjectsRequest) {
  return ListObjectsResponse;
}
createObject(CreateObjectRequest) {
  return CreateObjectResponse;
}
[grpc+insecure://127.0.0.1:8080]# rpc call listObjects {"offset":0,"limit":10}
{
  "objects": {
    "objects": []
  }
}
```

### Command-line Options

```
  Usage: grpcli [options] [config]

  Specifying a config will attempt to load the `config` section from
  your .grpcli configuration file. Any command-line parameters you pass in
  will override what is configured in the .grpcli config file.

  Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    -V, --version          output the version number
    -f, --file <file>      Absolute or relative path to the protobuf file
                           containing the gRPC service
    --ip <ip>              IP address of the gRPC service to connect to
    --port <port>          Port of the gRPC service to connect to
    -d, --dir [directory]  Absolute or relative path to the directory
                           where protobuf files should be loaded from
    -s, --service [name]   Name of the gRPC service to connect to
    -i, --insecure         Whether to connect insecurely
```
